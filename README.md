Getting user related information using web scraping methods and python

After clonning the repository, you should get into the folder via cmd and write the following command:
  python manage.py runserver

Following that, it will start serving a local server from which you can search for users.

Note: I didn't pay attention on the html interface, so open to any enhancements from that perspective.
